Gamer Grid is the eccentric sister-project of [Media Masterlist](https://danielledonnelly.github.io/media-masterlist-project/).

My goal is to use an API to pull game covers while going in a maximalist styling direcion.

Feel free to check the site out [here](https://danielledonnelly.github.io/gamer-grid/). It's still a work in progress!
