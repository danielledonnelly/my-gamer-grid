# [Gamer Grid](https://danielledonnelly.github.io/gamer-grid/) 
## Rate, rank, and review your favourite video games with this responsive table
✦ Type a title into the game column and watch as the IGDB API auto-fills the cell with the game's cover
  <br>✦ Can't find the cover you're looking for? Images can also be manually pasted into any cell
  <br>✦ To see a filled-in version of the table, check out [my personal Gamer Grid](https://danielledonnelly.github.io/my-gamer-grid/).
  <br><br>If you'd like to make your own live Gamer Grid page on GitHub, please duplicate the code from the repository and add in your own titles and images as needed like in the example above.
